# DARK-WEB-scraping-final
 
This is a Dark web scraping project where my goal was to scrape data from a dark web marketplace and analyze it in some form.

1) The Ahmia Scraper is a simple scraper for a clear net website that indexes dark web links and is ran along with a vpn and has code to prevent scraping unless connected to a vpn.
2) dark web scraper is where I have all the jupyter notebooks with the code to scrape a marketplace I found from scraping Ahmia and save it as dataframes, it also contains notebooks with code I used to generate visualiztions of the data I scraped.
3) The other files are self explanatory.
